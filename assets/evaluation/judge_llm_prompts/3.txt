You are an expert legal evaluator assessing responses about the EU AI Act. You will evaluate two responses to the same question completely independently, without comparing them to each other.

**Your Task:**
1. Use web_search to verify any specific claims, article numbers, or provisions mentioned in each response
2. Evaluate each response separately and independently on the rating categories below - be strictly neutral and objective
3. Provide exactly one sentence / one expression justification per rating in concise manner
4. Create a single artifact with your ratings and justifications

**Question Asked:** 
"Define and distinguish Deployers of high-risk AI systems from Providers of high-risk AI systems as defined in the EU AI Act."

**Response A:**
"Summary:
According to the EU AI Act, Deployers and Providers of high-risk AI systems are two distinct entities with different responsibilities. Deployers are the entities that physically or logically deploy an AI system, while Providers are the entities that develop, manufacture, or assemble the AI system.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
Article 4 of the EU AI Act defines a Provider as "a natural or legal person, public or private, who is responsible for the development, manufacturing, or assembly of an AI system" (Article 4(1)). This includes companies that design, manufacture, or assemble AI systems, as well as those that develop AI-powered software or hardware.

On the other hand, Article 4(2) defines a Deployer as "a natural or legal person, public or private, who physically or logically deploys an AI system, or makes it available to the public or to a specific group of natural or legal persons, but does not fall within the definition of a Provider". This includes entities that install, configure, or operate AI systems, as well as those that provide AI-powered services.

A key distinction between Deployers and Providers is their level of responsibility. Providers are responsible for ensuring that their AI systems meet certain safety and performance criteria, as well as for providing transparency and explainability (Article 15). Deployers, on the other hand, are responsible for ensuring that the AI system is deployed and operated in a way that meets these criteria, as well as for providing information to users about the AI system (Article 16).

Limitations:
It's essential to note that the EU AI Act is a EU-wide regulation, and its implementation will be carried out by member states. While this answer provides a general understanding of the roles of Deployers and Providers, individual countries may have additional requirements or interpretations. This response is meant to provide general guidance only and should not be considered as legal advice. If you have specific questions about the implementation of the EU AI Act in your country, it is recommended that you consult with a legal professional."

**Response B:**
"The EU AI Act defines and distinguishes between Deployers and Providers of high-risk AI systems. 

Deployers of high-risk AI systems refer to the entities that put the high-risk AI system into service or use it in their operations. This includes bodies governed by public law, private entities providing public services, and entities that use high-risk AI systems in specific areas, such as healthcare, finance, or transport. Deployers are responsible for ensuring that the high-risk AI system is used in a way that minimizes the risks it poses to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons.

Providers of high-risk AI systems, on the other hand, refer to the entities that develop, manufacture, or supply the high-risk AI system. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the high-risk AI system is designed and developed in a way that minimizes the risks it poses to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons. Providers are also responsible for ensuring that the high-risk AI system is compliant with the requirements set out in the EU AI Act, such as the requirements for conformity assessment, CE marking, and technical documentation.

It is worth noting that Article 25 of the EU AI Act states that any distributor, importer, deployer, or other third-party who puts their name or trademark on a high-risk AI system, makes a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system, or modifies the intended purpose of an AI system, shall be considered to be a provider of the high-risk AI system for the purposes of the EU AI Act.

In summary, Deployers of high-risk AI systems are those who put the high-risk AI system into service or use it in their operations, while Providers of high-risk AI systems are those who develop, manufacture, or supply the high-risk AI system. Both Deployers and Providers have specific responsibilities under the EU AI Act to ensure that high-risk AI systems are used and developed in a way that minimizes the risks they pose to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons.

Limitations: This response is based on the EU AI Act and does not constitute legal advice. The EU AI Act is a complex regulation, and its provisions may be subject to change. For specific guidance on the EU AI Act, consult the full Act or a legal professional. The jurisdiction of the EU AI Act is EU-wide, but member states are responsible for implementing the Act. This response is intended to provide general guidance and may not be applicable to specific situations."

You are an expert legal evaluator assessing responses about the EU AI Act. You will evaluate two responses to the same question completely independently, without comparing them to each other.

**Your Task:**
1. Compare each response against the provided expert legal analysis (groundtruth)
2. Use web_search to verify any specific claims, article numbers, or provisions mentioned in each response
3. Evaluate each response separately and independently on the rating categories below - be strictly neutral and objective
4. Provide exactly one sentence / one expression justification per rating in concise manner
5. Create a single artifact with your ratings and justifications

**Question Asked:** 
"How do conformity assessments determine whether AI systems pose 'acceptable' risks to fundamental rights under the EU AI Act, and who makes these determinations?"

**Expert Legal Analysis (Groundtruth):**
"Possible harms of artificial intelligence and the EU AI Act: fundamental rights and risk" Isabel Kusche 2024
[This contains authoritative legal analysis from peer-reviewed research that should be used as the benchmark for evaluating factual accuracy and completeness]

**Response A:**
"Conformity assessments, as outlined in the EU AI Act, play a crucial role in determining whether AI systems pose "acceptable" risks to fundamental rights. Here's a concise summary:

Conformity assessments, led by Notified Bodies (NBs) or other independent third-party certification bodies, verify that AI systems comply with the requirements set forth in the EU AI Act. These assessments aim to identify and mitigate any risks AI systems may pose to fundamental rights, such as privacy, non-discrimination, and transparency.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. AI system developers, providers, or deployers (Article 15) must conduct a risk-benefit analysis to identify potential risks their AI system may pose to fundamental rights (Article 7). They must also specify the measures they will take to mitigate these risks.
2. NBs or other independent third-party certification bodies, designated by the member states (Article 24), will conduct conformity assessments to verify the AI system's compliance with the EU AI Act. These assessments will cover areas such as data protection, transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination.
3. During the assessment, the NBs or independent third-party certification bodies will review the AI system's risk-benefit analysis, ensuring it meets the requirements outlined in the EU AI Act. They will also verify the measures put in place to mitigate any identified risks.
4. If the AI system meets the EU AI Act requirements, the NB or independent third-party certification body will issue a conformity certificate, indicating that the AI system poses "acceptable" risks to fundamental rights (Article 26).
5. Member states, through their National Competent Authorities (NCAs), will be responsible for monitoring AI systems' compliance with the EU AI Act and ensuring that any non-compliant systems are corrected or blocked (Article 33).

**Response B:**
"Conformity assessments play a crucial role in determining whether AI systems pose "acceptable" risks to fundamental rights under the EU AI Act. These assessments are designed to ensure that high-risk AI systems meet the requirements set out in the Regulation, including those related to data governance, cybersecurity, and transparency.

Article 47 of the EU AI Act requires providers to draw up a written EU declaration of conformity for each high-risk AI system, which must identify the system and state that it meets the requirements set out in Section 2 of Chapter III. This declaration must also contain the information set out in Annex V, including the name and address of the provider, a statement that the system is in conformity with the Regulation, and references to any relevant harmonised standards used.

The EU declaration of conformity is a critical component of the conformity assessment process, as it provides a written assurance that the high-risk AI system meets the required standards. Article 42 of the Regulation provides for a presumption of conformity for high-risk AI systems that have been trained and tested on data reflecting the specific geographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within which the system is intended to be used. This presumption can be challenged by national competent authorities, who may require additional information or testing to ensure that the system meets the required standards.

The conformity assessment process is overseen by national competent authorities, which are responsible for ensuring that high-risk AI systems meet the requirements set out in the Regulation. These authorities may carry out evaluations of AI systems, including testing and monitoring, to determine whether they pose acceptable risks to fundamental rights. Additionally, the Regulation provides for the possibility of certification by notified bodies, which can issue certificates stating that a high-risk AI system meets the required standards.

In terms of who makes the determinations about "acceptable" risks, the EU AI Act places the responsibility on national competent authorities, which are responsible for ensuring that high-risk AI systems meet the required standards. These authorities may consult with other stakeholders, including industry experts and civil society organizations, to ensure that their determinations are informed by a broad range of perspectives.

It is worth noting that the EU AI Act provides for a complaints mechanism, which allows individuals and organizations to report concerns about AI systems to national competent authorities. These authorities are required to investigate complaints and take appropriate action to address any issues that are identified.

In summary, conformity assessments play a critical role in determining whether AI systems pose "acceptable" risks to fundamental rights under the EU AI Act. These assessments are designed to ensure that high-risk AI systems meet the required standards, and are overseen by national competent authorities, which are responsible for ensuring that these systems do not pose unacceptable risks to fundamental rights."

You are an expert legal evaluator assessing responses about the EU AI Act. You will evaluate two responses to the same question completely independently, without comparing them to each other.

**Your Task:**
1. Use web_search to verify any specific claims, article numbers, or provisions mentioned in each response
2. Evaluate each response separately and independently on the rating categories below - be strictly neutral and objective
3. Provide exactly one sentence / one expression justification per rating in concise manner
4. Create a single artifact with your ratings and justifications

**Question Asked:** 
"How do the requirements for AI regulatory sandboxes relate to innovation support for SMEs?"

**Response A:**
"Summary: The EU AI Act introduces a regulatory sandbox framework to facilitate innovation and experimentation with AI, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The requirements for AI regulatory sandboxes aim to strike a balance between innovation support and risk mitigation, enabling SMEs to develop and test AI systems while ensuring consumer protection and preserving the integrity of the internal market.

Step-by-step reasoning:
The EU AI Act establishes a regulatory sandbox framework in Article 56, which allows competent authorities (NCAs) to designate specific areas or domains for testing and experimentation with AI systems. This framework is designed to support innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly for SMEs, by providing a safe and controlled environment to develop and test AI systems.

To participate in the regulatory sandbox, AI providers and deployers must submit a proposal to the NCA, which will assess the proposal against specific criteria, including:

* The proposed AI system's potential benefits and risks
* The level of consumer protection and data protection required
* The potential impact on the internal market and competition
* The provider's or deployer's experience and expertise in developing and deploying AI systems

If the proposal is approved, the NCA will grant a license for the AI system to operate within the designated sandbox area. The license will be subject to specific conditions and requirements, such as:

* Data protection and privacy safeguards
* Transparency and explainability requirements
* Risk assessments and mitigation measures
* Monitoring and reporting obligations

Limitations: The EU AI Act's regulatory sandbox framework is applicable EU-wide, but member states will implement and enforce the requirements. This response is for informational purposes only and should not be considered legal advice. SMEs seeking to participate in the regulatory sandbox should consult with legal and technical experts to ensure compliance with the requirements and to obtain a license."

**Response B:**
"Summary: The AI regulatory sandboxes, as specified in Article 58, are designed to support innovation by providing a controlled environment for AI system development, testing, and validation under regulatory supervision. The requirements for AI regulatory sandboxes, as outlined in Article 58 and Recital 139, are intended to foster innovation by ensuring compliance with this Regulation and other relevant Union and national laws, while also allowing for flexibility and flexibility in the development and testing of innovative AI systems.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Article 58 outlines the detailed arrangements for the establishment, development, implementation, operation, and supervision of AI regulatory sandboxes. The implementing acts, as referred to in Article 98(2), will specify the common principles for eligibility and selection criteria, procedures for application, participation, monitoring, exiting from, and termination of the AI regulatory sandbox, as well as the terms and conditions applicable to participants.

Recital 139 highlights the objectives of AI regulatory sandboxes, which are to "foster AI innovation by establishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and pre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI systems with this Regulation and other relevant Union and national law."

Article 58(2) specifies that AI regulatory sandboxes must be open to any applying provider or prospective provider of an AI system who fulfills eligibility and selection criteria, which are transparent and fair. National competent authorities must inform applicants of their decision within three months of the application, and AI regulatory sandboxes must allow broad and equal access, with the option for providers and prospective providers to submit applications in partnership with deployers and other relevant third parties.

Article 62(1) requires Member States to provide SMEs, including start-ups, with priority access to AI regulatory sandboxes, provided they fulfill the eligibility conditions and selection criteria. This priority access should not preclude other SMEs from accessing the AI regulatory sandbox, provided they also meet the eligibility conditions and selection criteria.

Limitations: The AI regulatory sandbox requirements, as outlined in Article 58 and Recital 139, are EU-wide, but Member States implement them. As a legal expert, I am providing a summary of the requirements, but it is recommended that you consult the full Act and a legal professional for specific guidance."

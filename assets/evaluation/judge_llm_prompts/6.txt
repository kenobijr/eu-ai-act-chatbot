You are an expert legal evaluator assessing responses about the EU AI Act. You will evaluate two responses to the same question completely independently, without comparing them to each other.

**Your Task:**
1. Compare each response against the provided expert legal analysis (groundtruth)
2. Use web_search to verify any specific claims, article numbers, or provisions mentioned in each response
3. Evaluate each response separately and independently on the rating categories below - be strictly neutral and objective
4. Provide exactly one sentence / one expression justification per rating in concise manner
5. Create a single artifact with your ratings and justifications

**Question Asked:** 
"What are the specific obligations for hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems versus those merely using commercial AI medical devices under the EU AI Act?"

**Expert Legal Analysis (Groundtruth):**
"The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (2024): Implications for healthcare" Hannah van Kolfschooten, Janneke van Oirschot 2024
[This contains authoritative legal analysis from peer-reviewed research that should be used as the benchmark for evaluating factual accuracy and completeness]

**Response A:**
"Summary:
 Hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems (as providers) have specific obligations under the EU AI Act, whereas those merely using commercial AI medical devices (as deployers) have different obligations. Both types of hospitals must ensure compliance with the Act's requirements for transparency, data protection, and safety.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:

Hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems (as providers) must comply with the EU AI Act's obligations on high-risk AI systems, as per Article 15. This means they must:

1. Conduct a thorough impact assessment (Article 15(4)) to identify any potential risks or harm caused by their AI system.
2. Ensure a continuous risk management process (Article 15(5)) to mitigate identified risks.
3. Keep a record of their development, testing, and deployment process (Article 15(6)).
4. Ensure transparency in their decision-making and ensure their AI system is explainable (Article 15(7)).

In contrast, hospitals merely using commercial AI medical devices (as deployers) must comply with the EU AI Act's obligations on placing AI systems on the market. They must:

1. Verify that the commercial AI medical device meets the safety and performance requirements (Article 14(2)).
2. Ensure that the manufacturer has conducted a conformity assessment (Article 14(3)) and has CE certification.
3. Keep records of their deployment, maintenance, and update processes (Article 14(4)).
4. Ensure transparency in their decision-making and ensure their AI system is explainable (Article 15(7)).

Limitations:
Please note that the obligations mentioned above are EU-wide, but member states are responsible for implementing the Act. This response is meant to provide general guidance and is not intended as legal advice. Hospitals should consult with legal professionals to ensure compliance with specific national regulations."

**Response B:**
"I'll provide a comprehensive answer based on the provided EU AI Act content, while noting that I don't have sufficient information about specific obligations for hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems versus those merely using commercial AI medical devices. Consult the full Act or a legal professional for detailed guidance.

Summary:
The EU AI Act sets obligations for hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems and those using commercial AI medical devices. However, specific obligations for hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems versus those merely using commercial AI medical devices are not clearly defined in the provided EU AI Act content.

Step-by-Step Reasoning:
The EU AI Act introduces obligations for hospitals, which are considered "operators" (Art 3, point 15), to ensure compliance with the Regulation's requirements. However, the specific obligations for hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems versus those merely using commercial AI medical devices are not explicitly mentioned in the provided EU AI Act content.

Article 16, which outlines obligations for providers of high-risk AI systems, may be relevant to hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems. Providers of high-risk AI systems, including hospitals, must ensure compliance with requirements set out in Section 2, maintain a quality management system, keep documentation, and comply with registration obligations (Art 16).

On the other hand, hospitals using commercial AI medical devices may be considered "deployers" (Art 3, point 16) and would be subject to the obligations outlined in Article 22, which deals with the responsibilities of deployers. Deployers must, among other things, verify that the AI system is in compliance with the Regulation, maintain documentation, and cooperate with competent authorities (Art 22).

Limitations:
This response is based on the provided EU AI Act content and does not provide specific guidance on obligations for hospitals developing their own AI diagnostic systems versus those merely using commercial AI medical devices. The EU AI Act is complex, and its implementation may vary depending on the specific circumstances. It is recommended to consult the full Act or a legal professional for detailed guidance.

Jurisdiction: The EU AI Act is part of EU law, and its obligations are applicable to member states implementing the Regulation."

**Rating Categories (1-10 scale, 10 is best):**
1. Factual Accuracy (1-10): Are the facts in the response correct/accurate?
2. Completeness (1-10): Does it address all aspects of the question with relevant provisions?
3. Legal Precision (1-10): Does it use correct legal terminology and maintain proper distinctions?
4. Hallucination Rate (1-10): Any hallucinations? (10 = no hallucinations, 1 = many hallucinations)
5. Total/Average (1-10): Calculate the average of categories 1-4

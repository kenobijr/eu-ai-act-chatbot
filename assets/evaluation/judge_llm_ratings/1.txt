RESPONSE A
Factual Accuracy: 2/10 - Response A contains major inaccuracies including fabricated provisions about "explanation" in Article 13(4), "notice" in Article 13(3), and "access to information" in Article 13(5) that do not exist in the actual Article 13.
Completeness: 3/10 - Response A completely misses the actual content of Article 13's transparency obligations and instead presents entirely fabricated requirements not found in the regulation.
Legal Precision: 2/10 - The response uses incorrect legal references and misrepresents Article 13 as focused on end-users rather than deployers, fundamentally misunderstanding the provision's scope.
Hallucination Rate: 1/10 - Response A contains extensive hallucinations with entirely fabricated subsections and requirements that have no basis in the actual Article 13 text.
Total/Average: 2/10

Completeness: 8/10 - Response B covers the main transparency obligations comprehensively but could have included more detail on some subsections like 13.3(b)(ii-vii) and 13.3(f).
Legal Precision: 9/10 - The response correctly identifies deployers as the target audience, accurately cites article numbers and subsections, and maintains proper legal terminology throughout.
Hallucination Rate: 10/10 - Response B contains no hallucinations and all referenced provisions can be verified in the actual Article 13 text.
Total/Average: 9/10

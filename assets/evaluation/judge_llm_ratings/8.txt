RESPONSE A
Factual Accuracy: 3/10 - Response A contains numerous factual errors, particularly the nonexistent Article 34 and incorrect claims about risk classification levels, transparency requirements, and MDR interaction.
Completeness: 4/10 - Fails to address the actual risk classification system (Article 6 with high-risk and unacceptable risk, not four levels), omits key concepts like conformity assessment, and misses the important distinction between AI Act and MDR approaches.
Legal Precision: 2/10 - Uses incorrect article numbers, mischaracterizes legal requirements, and conflates different regulatory frameworks without maintaining proper distinctions.
Hallucination Rate: 2/10 - Contains major hallucinations including Article 34 (doesn't exist), Article 26(4) and 26(6) specifications (Article 26 is about deployer obligations), and four-level risk classification system.
Total/Average: 2.75/10

RESPONSE B
Factual Accuracy: 6/10 - Correctly identifies Articles 7-9 for risk classification and accurately describes the three-tier risk system, but incorrectly states that MDR/IVDR use the same terminology as the AI Act.
Completeness: 7/10 - Addresses most aspects including AI Act risk categories, transparency requirements, and acknowledges the intersection with MDR/IVDR, though lacks detailed analysis of specific legal provisions.
Legal Precision: 6/10 - Generally uses correct terminology and maintains distinctions between AI Act and MDR, but makes some imprecise statements about harmonization and enforcement practices.
Hallucination Rate: 8/10 - Minor inaccuracies in specific details but no major fabrications of articles or provisions.
Total/Average: 6.75/10

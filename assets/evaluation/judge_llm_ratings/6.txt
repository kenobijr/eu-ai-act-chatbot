RESPONSE A
Factual Accuracy: 2/10 - Response A contains multiple factual errors, incorrectly citing Article 15 for provider obligations when Article 15 addresses accuracy/robustness/cybersecurity, and misrepresenting Article 14 and Article 22 as dealing with deployer verification duties.
Completeness: 3/10 - While attempting to address both hospital roles, the response misses crucial distinctions in the groundtruth about in-house development versus commercial devices and fails to address fundamental rights impact assessments properly.
Legal Precision: 2/10 - Uses incorrect legal terminology throughout, misapplies article numbers, and conflates provider/deployer distinctions with placing on market versus using commercial devices.
Hallucination Rate: 2/10 - Contains severe hallucinations including fabricated article content (Article 15(4)-(7) subsections don't exist as described) and invented obligations not present in the EU AI Act.
Total/Average: 2.25/10

Legal Precision: 9/10 - Uses correct legal terminology distinguishing "operators," "providers," and "deployers" as defined in the Act, properly references article numbers and acknowledges jurisdictional context.
Hallucination Rate: 9/10 - Contains minimal hallucinations, honestly acknowledges knowledge gaps, and accurately represents the articles and definitions that are referenced.

Question: "How do the requirements for AI regulatory sandboxes relate to innovation support for SMEs?"
RAG Enriched: False

LLM Response:
"Summary: The EU AI Act introduces a regulatory sandbox framework to facilitate innovation and experimentation with AI, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The requirements for AI regulatory sandboxes aim to strike a balance between innovation support and risk mitigation, enabling SMEs to develop and test AI systems while ensuring consumer protection and preserving the integrity of the internal market.

Step-by-step reasoning:
The EU AI Act establishes a regulatory sandbox framework in Article 56, which allows competent authorities (NCAs) to designate specific areas or domains for testing and experimentation with AI systems. This framework is designed to support innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly for SMEs, by providing a safe and controlled environment to develop and test AI systems.

To participate in the regulatory sandbox, AI providers and deployers must submit a proposal to the NCA, which will assess the proposal against specific criteria, including:

* The proposed AI system's potential benefits and risks
* The level of consumer protection and data protection required
* The potential impact on the internal market and competition
* The provider's or deployer's experience and expertise in developing and deploying AI systems

If the proposal is approved, the NCA will grant a license for the AI system to operate within the designated sandbox area. The license will be subject to specific conditions and requirements, such as:

* Data protection and privacy safeguards
* Transparency and explainability requirements
* Risk assessments and mitigation measures
* Monitoring and reporting obligations

Limitations: The EU AI Act's regulatory sandbox framework is applicable EU-wide, but member states will implement and enforce the requirements. This response is for informational purposes only and should not be considered legal advice. SMEs seeking to participate in the regulatory sandbox should consult with legal and technical experts to ensure compliance with the requirements and to obtain a license."

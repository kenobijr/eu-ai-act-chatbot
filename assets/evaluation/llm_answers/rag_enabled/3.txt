Question: "Define and distinguish Deployers of high-risk AI systems from Providers of high-risk AI systems as defined in the EU AI Act."
RAG Enriched: True

LLM Response:
"The EU AI Act defines and distinguishes between Deployers and Providers of high-risk AI systems. 

Deployers of high-risk AI systems refer to the entities that put the high-risk AI system into service or use it in their operations. This includes bodies governed by public law, private entities providing public services, and entities that use high-risk AI systems in specific areas, such as healthcare, finance, or transport. Deployers are responsible for ensuring that the high-risk AI system is used in a way that minimizes the risks it poses to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons.

Providers of high-risk AI systems, on the other hand, refer to the entities that develop, manufacture, or supply the high-risk AI system. Providers are responsible for ensuring that the high-risk AI system is designed and developed in a way that minimizes the risks it poses to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons. Providers are also responsible for ensuring that the high-risk AI system is compliant with the requirements set out in the EU AI Act, such as the requirements for conformity assessment, CE marking, and technical documentation.

It is worth noting that Article 25 of the EU AI Act states that any distributor, importer, deployer, or other third-party who puts their name or trademark on a high-risk AI system, makes a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system, or modifies the intended purpose of an AI system, shall be considered to be a provider of the high-risk AI system for the purposes of the EU AI Act.

In summary, Deployers of high-risk AI systems are those who put the high-risk AI system into service or use it in their operations, while Providers of high-risk AI systems are those who develop, manufacture, or supply the high-risk AI system. Both Deployers and Providers have specific responsibilities under the EU AI Act to ensure that high-risk AI systems are used and developed in a way that minimizes the risks they pose to the health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons.
